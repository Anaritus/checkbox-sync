# checkbox-sync

Sync utility for checkboxes in markdown, powered by [treesitter].

Heavily inspired by [tree-sitter-org], but does not require to use specific
mapping to work. Instead, there are two hooks, that you yourself decide when
should trigger.

I wrote it for myself to solve my specific problem, as such I do not plan to
heavily maintain it, but contributors are welcome!
